Image processing libraries:
skimage regionprops - haven't figured out how to use this yet, but it should extract the leaves from the image
edge detection with Canny, laplacian, sobel
cv2 threshold - creates a binary image
connected components - connects the lines from the edge detector and the binary image
cv2 resize - resizes the image
boundingRect - this creates a bounding box
findContours - pretty much edge detection
